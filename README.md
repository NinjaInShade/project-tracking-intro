## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla javascript

### What I learned

I practiced my positioning a lot, with the image especially.

Another thing I had to take careful care of is z index of multiple elemtents so things stacked correctly, whilst keeping the code maintainable and not using over the top z index's like 9999 etc. I had to ensure the background rectangle stayed underneath everything, while the mobile navigation was over the top of everything, which I had to focus to do as there positions in the HTML were different (position in html creates different stacking contexts).
